## TE3002 Robotics Intelligent Implementation


This directory will contain all the work that was done during the 10 week robotics course in which a Manchester Robotics Puzzlebot will be programed.

We have added a new team member in this class.

This directory will be divided in weekly progress starting on week 2, the final challenge advancements will be located on the "Final Challenge" folder.
We will develop a Puzzlebot which will run across a little street with traffic signals, which shall be detected by a Camera to be processed in a Jetson processor with ROS and Vision Processing.

### Objectives
We plan on developing a Gazebo simulation of the puzzlebot to train a Machine Learning model through Reinforcement Learning for the robot to follow different paths without problem, while also gathering information from the camera and infrared sensor as sensorial feedback. THis simulation will be helpful to test a ROS implementation without having to place it on the puzzelbot, the only difference will be that the robot has physical uncertainties which will affect the implementation that was planned in the simulator.

We will design 3 Blender tracks to do our simulation, as well as obtain the Puzzlebot CAD to place it on Gazebo and Rviz.
