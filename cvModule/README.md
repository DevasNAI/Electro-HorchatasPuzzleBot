# Computer Vision Module
  The computer vision module presents us with different kinds of applications and usage of computer vision within the industry and the principles of the camera models that allow us to process images as we need.

## Quasi-static robot Visuocontrol
  Having learned the fundamentals of computer vision, starting from pinholes cameras, to stereo camera models, this section presents an application of some of the different models to detect aspects of an image in order to do a certain action.
  
  The objective of this challenge, is use the concepts of epipolar geometry and single view metrology to select a box from a simulating environment and teleoperate a robot (with the minimum degrees of freedom to reach the object, which moves asuming a perfect velocity and position control) to take each box and collocate them in a position objective.
